        <p>The Blackfoot would eat hooved and horned animals. They would not eat anything with claws like eagles.
            <br>Although, they would use clawed animal pieces for ceremonial purposes or for jewlery.
            <br> The buffalo was one of the most important food sources. All of the buffalo parts were used, nothing was
            labelled as useless.

    <section class="container wrapper buffparts">
        <ul><b>Hide/Fur</b>: The Hide with the fur still attatched was used as blankets to keep warm in the harsh
            winters. The hide without the fur was used for tipi's, clothing, and moccasins. </ul>
        <ul><b>Horns:</b> The horns were used as cups or to transfer fires by stuffing the horn with moss or dry grass
            and capturing an ember from a previous fire.</ul>
        <ul><b>Brain:</b> The brain was used to wet the hide in order to get it soft and flexible for tipi's, clothing
            and moccasins. </ul>
        <ul><b>Tail:</b> The tail was used as a fly swatter to get rid of flies.</ul>
        <ul><b>Hooves:</b>The hooves had a gel inside, which was used as glue.</ul>
        <ul><b>Stomach:</b> The stomach was used as a pot to cook their foods in. They would heat rocks in a fire, dig a
            hole in the ground, place their food inside the stomach of the buffalo, place it inside the hole in the
            gorund along with the heated rocks and then cover it up and act as an oven.</ul>
        <ul><b>Bladder:</b> The bladder was used as a water bottle to drink their water.</ul>
